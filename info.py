# Why python is a dynamic language?
    # readability 
    # easy to execute 
    # no need to define data type 
    # easy to understand 
    
# below are the data types:
    # int -- 1, 2, 3
    # float -- 1.1, 2.8
    # boolean -- True/Falsed 
    # string --- "kupa"  'kupa'   '''this is for the paragraph'''

# below are data structure 
    # list []
    # tuple ()---- immutable 
    # dictionary { -----key:value pairs----- }
    # sets {} -----unordered

# variables 
    # it an element used to store data e.g a="kupa"
    #........... Rules for varables .........
        #WE CANNOT START WITH A NUMBER 
        #IT STARTS WITH UNDERSCORE OR ALPHABATE
        #CASE SENSETIVE 

# comments  
    # used to explain the code 
    # used to store the code for future use 
    # used to stop the data from executing during execution of the code 

#sample simple code 
print("Hello WOrld")
